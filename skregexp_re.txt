SkRegExp Regular Expressions Version 3.0.4

1. NEWLINE CONVENTION

These are recognized only at the very start of the pattern or after option settings with a similar syntax.

  (*CR)           carriage return only
  (*LF)           linefeed only
  (*CRLF)         carriage return followed by linefeed
  (*ANYCRLF)      all three of the above
  (*ANY)          any Unicode newline sequence

2. MODIFIERS

  m  Multiline mode - ^ and $ match internal lines
  s  match as a Single line - . matches \n
  i  case-Insensitive
  x  eXtended legibility - free whitespace and comments
  a  restrict \d, \s, \w and [:posix:] to match ASCII only
  aa (two a's) also /i matches exclude ASCII/non-ASCII
  l, u, d  match according to Unicode rules

                     (?!pat)   negative look-ahead

10. CALLOUTS

  (?C)      callout
  (?Cn)     callout with data n

11. BACKTRACKING CONTROL

The following act immediately they are reached:

  (*ACCEPT)       force successful match
  (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)
  (*MARK:NAME)    set name to be passed back; synonym (*:NAME)

The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a backtrack to reach them. They all force a match failure, but they differ in what happens afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do so only if the pattern is not anchored.

  (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
  (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
  (*PRUNE:NAME)   equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*PRUNE)
  (*SKIP)         advance to current matching position
  (*SKIP:NAME)    advance to position corresponding to an earlier
                  (*MARK:NAME); if not found, the (*SKIP) is ignored
  (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation
  (*THEN:NAME)    equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*THEN)
